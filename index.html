                    During this time I didn't use technology/ my phone that much. I was working a full-time job and I was a full-time student, so I didn't really have the time to be on my phone. In total, I spent 43 hours of the week on technology/the internet. I spent 13 hours on Spotify because I always listen to music when I'm on the train or subway. I spent 9 hours on Indesign because I am a communcation design major and we use Indesign most of the time. I spent a total of 18 hours on apps and website that were made for entertainment (11 hours on Netflix, 3 hours on Instagram, 3 hours on Youtube, and an hour on Snapchat). I, lastly spent 1 hour on the school website/canvas.
